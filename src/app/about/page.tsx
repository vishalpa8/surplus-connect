      <p>
        Welcome to SurplusConnect, where we believe that good food belongs in bellies, not bins. Our mission is simple: to create a world where no food goes to waste. We are a passionate team of developers, food lovers, and environmentalists dedicated to solving the paradox of food waste in a world with food insecurity.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        SurplusConnect was born from a simple observation: while local businesses were throwing away perfectly good, unsold food at the end of the day, many people in the same communities were struggling to make ends meet. We saw an opportunity to bridge this gap using technology. We envisioned a platform that was simple for businesses to use, affordable for consumers, and a reliable resource for non-profits.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to build a more sustainable and equitable food system. We empower local communities to fight food waste by connecting food vendors, consumers, and NGOs. Every meal rescued on our platform is a step towards a healthier planet and a stronger community.
      </p>
      <h2>Join Us</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a business looking to reduce waste, a consumer searching for great deals, or an NGO working to feed your community, we invite you to join us. Together, we can make a difference, one meal at a time.
